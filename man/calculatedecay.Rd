\title{Calculates decay values}
\usage{
calculatedecay(halfLives. = halfLives)
}
\arguments{
\item{halfLives.}{data frames of half lives}
}
\value{
four dimensional array
}
\description{
creating blank four-dimensional array to fill
}
\details{
1. Decay Type (1 = exponential, 2 = k=2, 3 = chi-squared)
2. End Use (1 = Single Family Housing, 2 = Multifamily Housing, 3 = Mobile Homes, 4 = Residential Upkeep and Improvement, 5 = All Construction Excluding Railroads, 6 = Railroad Ties, 7 = Railcar Repair, 8 = Household Furniture, 9 = Commercial Furniture, 10 = Other Manufacturing, 11 = Shipping, 12 = Other Uses, 13 = Uses for Other Industrial Products)
3. Year Put in Use (1 = 1900)
4. Year (1 = 1900)
Example: decay_array[1, 3, 51, 101] will produce percentage carbon left after exponential decay of mobile homes built in 1950 at year 2000
Example: decay_array[1, 3, 51, ] will produce a vector of percentage carbon left after exponential decay of mobile homes built in 1950 for years 1950 - end year
Example: decay_array[1, 3, , 101] will produce a vector of percentage carbon left after exponential decay of mobile homes built from 1900 to 2000 in the year 2000
